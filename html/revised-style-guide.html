      <p class="post-text">
        I have decided to keep the design and style of my website very similar
        to my prototype. Even though I only released that there is a space theme
        that goes towards this website with the use of the NASA API. My website
        style still can use this space theme. This is because the negative space
        is black representing the emptiness in space. Since I am using the
        colour orange and it is not used in large amounts, it has a
        representation towards the sun as just like how important the sun is,
        the orange colour in my website is used to highlight and emphasize
        aspects of my website. The use of keeping my colour selection ensures
        brand consistency. The chosen colours provide contrast, ensure
        readability, and impart a modern, sleek feel.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Homepage:</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        Header: The header is fixed with a transparent background that turns
        solid black colour when scrolled. The logo size adjusts to the size of
        the navbar by always remaining constant on the screen. The use of the
        fixed headers offers constant navigation, improving user experience. The
        transition effect adds dynamism to the design.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Navigation: The navbar is a part of horizontal navigation links for
        larger screens, which is also collapsible for smaller screens, and there
        are also active navigation links highlighted with the main colour
        (orange). It allows for responsive navigation ensures accessibility
        across devices, and the highlight provides a visual cue for users.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Main Content Area: The main content area uses a grid system to display
        content. The content sections use cards with rounded corners, images,
        and descriptive text. This is because the grid systems provide
        organization and scalability. Card designs compartmentalize information,
        making it easier to understand.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Buttons: All the buttons have a consistent styling with a rounded edge,
        the primary action buttons are styled with a coloured background and
        transition effects. As in doing this, the button styles make the site
        intuitive. Transition effects provide feedback, enhancing user
        experience.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Selection Pages:</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        All my selection pages follow a certain structure, which allows for a
        responsive website that showcases blogs, posts, and related to "Data
        Visualisation". The primary visual elements are images fetched from
        NASA's API. The header and footer are dynamically generated using
        JavaScript, making it easy to maintain and modify. My website's design
        is made responsive using media queries in CSS.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">HTML Structure:</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        The Header Contains a fixed navigation bar, The structure of the navbar
        is empty but it does get populated using JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Main Content: The first section is dedicated to the heading for the
        section, Data Visualisation, Blogs, and Design with a subtitle giving a
        short explanation of the heading or what is in the section. There are
        also two sub-sections or posts under the title, each containing: <br />
        - An image from NASA, which seems to be set dynamically using JavaScript
        based on data attributes, or static images set through HTML using a
        PNG/jpeg. <br />- A title which also acts as a link. <br />
        - A description.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">Footer: Which is populated through JS.</p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Style:</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        The typography of the website is: <br />
        - Primary Font: 'Playfair Display', serif <br />
        - Secondary Font: 'Poppins', sans-serif <br />
        - Font Weight: Ranges from regular (400) to semi-bold (600). <br />
        - Font Sizes: Uses responsive design with sizes defined in `rem` to
        adjust relative to the root font size. This ensures that typography
        scales uniformly across devices. This allows for consistent theming as
        the use of fonts, colours, and styles across the website offers a
        cohesive user experience.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Layout: The main content centres on the title and subtitle. It uses a
        grid layout for the posts, which adjusts based on viewport size. The
        Post Structure includes an image, title, and description. The title is
        limited to two lines using `-webkit-line-clamp`. The spacing between
        letters and lines is consistent usage of padding and margins to ensure
        elements have room to "breathe" so that the content is readable and
        legible.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Interactive Elements: The buttons & links in the website use a
        transition for colour changes, creating a smooth visual effect on hover.
        There is also a scroll behaviour allowing for smooth scrolling, which
        enhances the user experience by providing gradual navigation when
        jumping between sections.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Images: The images for design in css for adaptive sizing so that they
        can resize and adjust to their layout according to the viewport size.
        The images are positioned to use `object-fit`, which will ensure images
        cover their container without distortion.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Reasoning for UI/UX:</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        There is a responsive design, through the use of media queries, so the
        website can adapt to various screen sizes, ensuring it's accessible on
        both mobile devices and desktops.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        The smooth transitions allow for transitions on buttons and links to
        have an interaction feeling which is fluid and responsive to user
        actions.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        The use of dynamic content, as in fetching images from NASA's API
        dynamically, the website feel fresh and updated, enhancing the user's
        sense of discovery.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        From a UI perspective, this website appears to look sleek and modern.
        The usage of contemporary techniques, like smooth scrolling and
        transitions, combined with dynamic content, ensures it feels fresh and
        engaging element to the website so the user is actively invested in the
        website.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        From a UX standpoint, the user's journey is considered and optimized.
        Fixed navigation, feedback on interaction, and responsive design all
        contribute to a more seamless and intuitive user experience.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">The Graphs/Charts</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        Layout & Structure: Using a Centering, Graph container, and Tooltip
        elements is effective for the layout and structure as it guides the
        users through content naturally and intuitively while benefiting the
        users as they can navigate the content effortlessly and access desired
        information faster. The use of the tooltips provides immediate context
        or extra details, enhancing user understanding without cluttering the
        main content.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Interactive Elements(Bar Colors, Dropdowns, Button): This is effective
        as the Interactive elements provide feedback and make websites more
        engaging. As it is easier for users to interact with and understand data
        or content. Colour-coded bars, for instance, can quickly convey
        differences or significance in data, while dropdowns offer choices
        without overwhelming the user.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Interactivity (Hovering Effects, Dropdowns, Dynamic Data Rendering):
        This is effective interactivity as it makes a website dynamic and
        responsive to user actions. So the users receive immediate feedback,
        which keeps them engaged and makes the experience feel intuitive and
        alive.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Visual Feedback (Tooltip, Color Transitions): The use of visual feedback
        reinforces user interactions, letting them know the system is responding
        to their actions. So Users feel more in control and confident in their
        actions on the website, reducing potential confusion.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Easy Data Access (Dropdowns for Data Selection): Instead of overwhelming
        the user with loads of data, dropdowns allow them to select specific
        datasets they're interested in, which allows for a more personalized
        experience and so the users can access the information they find most
        relevant, leading to increased satisfaction and engagement.
