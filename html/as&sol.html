        Solar Flares are eruptions of intense high-energy radiation from the
        Sun's surface, mainly caused by magnetic activity. Did you know they can
        release as much energy as a billion atomic bombs in just a few minutes?
        If it reaches Earth effects directed towards us can disrupt satellite
        communication, GPS systems, and power grids. They can also enhance
        auroras (like the Northern Lights).
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Close-Approaching Asteroids also known as Near-Earth Objects (NEOs), are
        asteroids whose orbits bring them close to the Earth. They are tracked
        because of the potential threat they pose to us. As NEOs pass by us
        harmlessly, there is always a risk that one could collide with our
        planet. Such a collision could have devastating consequences, depending
        on the size and speed of the asteroid.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Relationship between the two:</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        Both solar flares and close-approaching asteroids are phenomena that
        come from space and can have implications for Earth, they aren't
        directly related though, and either can cause the other to happen.
        However, studying both these is essential for understanding potential
        space hazards and ensuring safety for us. I wanted to show these two
        types of phenomena in graphs as it allows us to see the different
        hazards that could affect us if they were to reach us.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        I decided to do a visual representation of these two as a bar and line
        graph with a pie chart making it easier for the user to understand
        trends of the solar flare and how many close approaching asteroids there
        are, alongside pie charts to represent the sizes of the asteroid and the
        type of solar flares that happen so the user find a patterns at a glance
        through the data visuals. It also allows for user engagement, as they
        can engage with the visuals, such as graphs and charts, which can grab
        the user's attention longer than blocks of text. Also, make sure the
        users stay on the website longer and learn more about the topic as they
        can visually understand it.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        I also chose these two aspects as they can bring awareness. As
        displaying data sets about these topics can raise awareness about space
        events and the hazards of NEOs and solar flares. In also showing these 2
        aspects these can be a comparison comparing the number of asteroids and
        the number of solar flares to understand if they can affect us one day,
        through understanding how many are happening around us and the magnitude
        of each.
