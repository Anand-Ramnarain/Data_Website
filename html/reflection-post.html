        In the digital age, a website is now the first point of contact with its
        audience. However, just having a website is not enough; the way a user
        interacts with the website and experiences it can be the difference
        between a fleeting visit and a lasting impression. User Interface
        focuses on the look and layout, referring to the visual aspect. While
        the user experience dives deeper into the emotional and functional
        experience of users. It examines how users feel as they navigate the
        site. This blog post will attempt to analyse the UI and UX of my
        website, using the works of Knaflic's Principles, identifying its
        strengths and areas of improvement.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        The most prominent visual design that stands out, is the colour scheme,
        cantering around black, white and orange. The black and white colour
        scheme offers one of the highest contrasts, The use of these two
        colours, in the website is primarily on the background and text, which
        ensures text is legible and readable to the user. The orange colour in
        the website is a highlighting colour against a monochromatic background,
        thus it is a “leverage colour selectively”( Knaflic 2015, 117).
        Explaining how using a certain colour sparingly is an important
        strategic tool as it guides user attention to key aspects of the
        website, eliminating distractions and causing the user to first focus on
        the colour. The use of this especially on the buttons, provides a “Call
        to Action”(Goldberg pp, 11). Encouraging users towards the content, to
        click it. Making it more likely that the user will stay on the website
        or want to read/view more about the content.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        hese Images below indicate the colour scheme of the website. The image
        of the right if we look at the bottom we can see how it uses the orange
        colour for a “Call To Action”.
      </p>
      <img
        src="../Images/figure1.jpg"
        alt="Cover Image. It is not important"
        class="header-img nexttoo"
      />
      <img
        src="../Images/figure2.jpg"
        alt="Cover Image. It is not important"
        class="header-img nexttoo"
      />
      <p class="post-text">
        Further, we will investigate the typography. The typography of the
        website features Poppins for content and Playfair Display for headings.
        Poppins' modern and geometric design offers a clear reading experience,
        while Playfair Display uses a high-contrast and serifed design, which is
        great for heading but not good a small text. Using these two fonts
        together balances design, as it creates an aesthesis design while making
        content easy to read, creating a contemporary web experience. In Figure
        1.1 it can be seen how Playfair is used as a heading while Poppins is
        for content.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Alongside this is the size of the elements. Sizing is a very important
        aspect of UI as it can “attract attention and signal importance.”
        (Knaflic 2015, p 129) The sizing effect has a similar meaning to the
        colour in a way it can show what is important and just how two elements
        can be equal in meaning or relevance. It shows how the size of certain
        elements can be used for an indication of something.
      </p>
      <img
        src="../Images/figure3.jpg"
        alt="Cover Image. It is not important"
        class="header-img"
      />
      <p class="post-text">
        The above image indicates the topic of the section is “Data
        Visualisation” and that this is the heading and it has significant
        importance to indicate to the user the section they are reading about.
        The text is smaller as it is a summary of what is in the section. It is
        seen that the button is considerably large. Considering, this is on the
        homepage is an indication to the users, so they know which section they
        are on, and what is about. The larger button plays a role in CTA to get
        the user to want to read more about it. These visual element as designed
        to enhance the user's experience in making a clear understanding and
        viewing of what is important, so their experience is simple and easy as
        the content and value is indicated through its size and colour that is
        legible and readable.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        These aspects of visual design are all used together for aesthetics but
        to further understand it we must investigate its layout and structure.
        The homepage uses a black screen as negative space and the content text
        is a white colour drawing users focus so they know what to look at. The
        homepage uses both edge alignment and centre alignment. Yes, they are
        for different sections as it displays different content but it ends up
        creating an uneasy feeling toward the user as there is no consistency in
        its alignment. To counter this mix of alignments, the other webpages are
        consistent in a centre alignment, while using a white background with
        black text keeping the content centred and making it the focus, allowing
        it to appear clear, confident, elegant, formal and trustworthy.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        There is also Interactivity, referring to the animations, transitions,
        and how the users interact with the website, when combined with the
        visual UI, it creates the user experience. The first interaction aspect
        is the navigation bar. The nav bar is a consistent aspect of the website
        as it always remains on screen and its style never changes throughout
        each webpage allowing for consistency and ensuring its user-friendly
        nature. As it easily navigates to each section provided on the nav bar.
        The only concern with the nav bar is that it doesn’t highlight which
        webpage the user is on, but this counts as each webpage does state the
        section they are in, still allowing for the user to each where they are.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Furthermore, the transitions of the website are smooth so the user
        experience is more enjoyable and intuitive. Aiding users to understand
        where they are and where they are going on the site. There is also an
        animation effect as when the user scrolls down on the homepage the
        content slowly appears. The use of this effect is firstly removing
        clutter to draw focus on what they can see. Knaflic's Principles are
        explained as they aid in content seeming simpler to the user, so it
        doesn’t overwhelm the user. (Knaflic 2015, pp 73) The use of these
        effects allows for a “cognitive load reduction” (Knaflic 2015, p 71) as
        the changes aren’t so abrupt, making it reduce the cognitive load on
        users by providing so they have a clearer sense of continuity on the
        website and so they can process the information, so it doesn’t seem
        overcomplicated.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Even though the UI helps in creating an effective and simple user
        experience, there is still a concern for user control. In the blog and
        design section, there are no previous or next icons. But there is a
        constant top button on the website. Which can take the user back to the
        top of the webpage where they will be able to navigate back a screen.
      </p>
      <img
        src="../Images/figure4.jpg"
        alt="Cover Image. It is not important"
        class="header-img others"
      />
      <p class="post-text">
        The image indicates the top icon, which uses Law 3 of the laws of
        locality as the element is placed where it will not effect change to the
        website but is still available to the user to interact with. Allowing
        the user to always have a clear knowledge that there is always where to
        go on the page, thus creating consistency as the user experience feels
        more cohesive and predictable, as there is always an option for them.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        he next aspect of the UI and UX is the responsive design. It's designed
        to be responsive for multiple screens. On desktops, the full navigation
        bar is displayed, with content spread out in a manner that maximizes the
        use of the larger screen. This ensures that users can quickly identify
        the main sections and navigate with ease. Since it was designed firstly
        for a desktop it was made for intuitive navigation as the user is
        immediately presented with all available options. The large use of
        negative space, alongside the content display of layout and columns made
        it easy to create a responsive design. For smaller devices, the
        navigation bar is replaced with a menu icon. Upon interaction, the full
        navigation options slide down. The content is also restructured to fit
        these devices, generally employing a column-based layout. There downside
        in the responsive design, lost on all webpages except the homepage as
        the menu icon is unable to load the navigate on all pages, but there is
        still a button to make sure the users can move around the website. This
        allows for it to meet the user expectations, as many users now expect
        websites to adjust according to their device because “Many users depend
        mostly or entirely on mobile access;”(Fukuda, Course Notes). The
        expectation isn't just about fit but also about functionality and ease
        of use. Making the user experience easier as they can access the website
        on these devices.
      </p>
      <img
        src="../Images/figure5.jpg"
        alt="Cover Image. It is not important"
        class="header-img nextto"
      />
      <img
        src="../Images/figure6.jpg"
        alt="Cover Image. It is not important"
        class="header-img nextto"
      />
      <p class="post-text">
        Finally, the last aspect of the UI is the performance. The website’s
        performance is relatively fast as the design and text content load fast,
        but the issue comes with the images. The images on the website take time
        to load, making it seem as if there may not be any images. Even with the
        use of compressed panda to reduce the image's size, it is still
        ineffective, but I have included alt text in the image in HTML which
        should describe what the image is about.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Therefore, after a careful analysis of the website’s UI and how that
        guides the UX. We have identified the strengths and areas of improvement
        in the website, to which I can make a more effective and responsive
        website that will use the UI to guide users for an easier and simpler
        experience.
