      <h2 class="sub-heading">Aesthetic Goal:</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        The goal of the website is to inspire the user by curating a visually
        captivating and immersive online experience that seamlessly navigation
        and blends in design, using minimalism, and modern functionality.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Colour:</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        Orange: In my website, I use the colour orange on crucial words and some
        aspects of the website. This is because the colour orange is highly
        visibility and draws the user’s attention, as orange is a bright and
        attention-grabbing colour. It is used sparingly, so it can direct a
        user's attention to specific keywords or specific actions leading the
        user drawn to those aspects on the page so they will want to view it or
        click on it. The use of orange is also for a contrasting effect in my
        web design, as the contrast is essential for readability, guiding the
        user, and highlighting the user’s attention to the elements. Since the
        primary colour of the website is focused on darker colours mainly black
        and grey, using orange for keywords makes it stand out. This allows for
        the encouragement of action and distinction of my hyperlinks. This is
        because orange is usually a bright colour and it allows for elements to
        stand out which in return encourages the users to click the elements
        with the orange colour.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        The use of the colour orange also creates a form of branding towards the
        website while allowing for an aesthetic to be created. This is because
        the colour is warm and comforting as it is associated with the sun and
        fire, so it makes the website feel inviting and cosy. Because of this,
        it will draw an emotional response from the users the colour has
        connotations of happiness, creativity and encouragement thus creating a
        positive feeling on the website and allowing a brand to be built to the
        website.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Black & White: The use of black and white colour on the website mainly
        for the website’s backgrounds and text colours is for a contrast that
        allows for readability. The white on a black background or visa-versa,
        creates a strong contrast, which makes the content more legible and
        eye-catching, thus allowing so the user can focus on the content as it
        minimizes distractions on the website. The use of black and white
        colours is to reduce eye strain for users. Contrasting these two colours
        allows the user to focus on the content while making sure the eye isn’t
        drawn away as it colour is too bright and strains their eye making it so
        they have to look away from the screen.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        The use of black and white is also aiding in establishing the brand of
        the website, as the black and white colours are usually associated with
        luxury brands, thus making it seem as if the website is conveying
        something high-end.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        These colours allow for the aesthetic of my website to be simplistic and
        timeless. As these colours are commonly used and they never go wrong if
        used correctly. It allows for a simple design on the website so that it
        doesn’t overcomplicate the website and that users can understand what is
        happing on the website.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Fonts:</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        Poppins: The font Poppins has a modern-day appearance to it, making it
        seem clean allowing it to fit into all types of designs on the website.
        I have used Poppins for large bodies of text as well as for certain
        headings. This is because this font is readable and consistent. As its
        design allows for all text to be easily readable as its appearance is
        consistent among each character. I have used Poppins as it has a modern
        appearance, as Poppins has acontemporary aesthetic, which makes the
        website seem fresh and modern, making it so the user is more engaged.
        The Poppin font works well for data visualisation as its modern
        appearance makes it appealing and it sets a neutral tone. This is
        important so that the font doesn't add any unintended bias or emotion to
        the data being presented so that the user to make their own decision
        based on what is being presented.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        This font is also effective for the brand of the website as it creates a
        professional appearance. As Poppins offers a clean and professional
        appearance because of its geometric design, making the data
        visualization appear trustworthy. Creating a website that feels safe to
        use and trust the information on it.
      </p>
      <img src="../Images/poppins.png" alt="Poppins Font Image" class="header-img" />
      <p class="post-text">
        Playfair Display: The font Playfair is aesthetically pleasing as it is
        elegant in its design and provides a high sense of elegance to a
        website. This is because this font is associated with high-end brands.
        Which will make the user feel as if the content on this website is
        worthy of being read. Because of this elegance in its design, it makes
        the content feel as if it was thoughtfully presented. The use of
        Playfair allows for content to be more memorable. The uniqueness of the
        font will make data visualization more memorable to viewers, allowing it
        to capture the user’s attention while making sure they remember the
        content.
      </p>
      <img src="../Images/playfair.png" alt="Playfair Display Font Image" class="header-img" />
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Why use these fonts together?</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        Using these two fonts together creates a contrasting effect: This is so
        that each font type can stand out making it so that certain elements are
        highlighted and use these two types of font is because they are similar
        in a way and they don’t clash with each other, rather making element
        eye-catching. It also creates a. sense of hierarchy. As the Playfair
        Display has a decorative and clean feel, works well for headings. On the
        other hand, "Poppins," being a more neutral and straightforward font, is
        excellent for body text or smaller text elements, making it so text
        elements stand out. They also both work together in setting a mood and
        tone to create an aesthetic and brand for the website. As Playfair
        Display has a sense of elegance due to its design, while "Poppins"
        offers a fresh, modern feel. When combined, they can create a mood that
        is both modern and timeless.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Negative Space:</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        On my website, I have to it so that each section is displayed to show
        what is important and it surrounds by negative space. This is for
        readability and comprehension on the website. The use of negative space
        makes content, with the text, more legible, easier to understand and
        easy to locate. The space between the element of done in a way that
        allows the user to easily read the content without losing track of where
        they are in the text and it is space so that the content on the website
        is easy to understand.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        The use of negative space on my website allows for focus and attention
        to the content provided. The negative space is used to draw the viewer's
        attention to specific content or elements, such as the way to separate
        each section on the page allowing the user to view each section
        separately allowing them to focus on that specific content. By removing
        clutter, allowing having what is necessary and using the negative space,
        the main message or action of the website becomes clearer. The use of
        negative space on my website creates a sense of balance. As the negative
        space creates a balance between design elements, ensuring that the page
        doesn't feel too crowded or overwhelming. This creates a professional
        and clean aesthetic and brand. As the websites use negative space to
        appear more professional and trustworthy. Because of this, it allows for
        an enhanced user experience. The design incorporates negative space to
        improve the overall user experience. It provides visual rest for the
        user's eyes, making it easier for users to navigate and interact with
        the site.

        is dependent on the content of each webpage. Here we will view and
        analyse the webpage layout and structure of each page.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Common features for page layout:</h2>
