      <p class="post-text">
        This document will provide a planning structure and reason for creating
        three types of static data visualizations using D3.js and NASA API.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">My Goals:</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        - I want to create visually engaging and informative data visualizations
        using D3.js. <br />
        - I will use NASA API to fetch relevant data to create each
        Visualisation. <br />
        - Develop interactive features to enhance user experience.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">The Data Visualizations:</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        • Bar graph for Number of solar flares. <br />
        • Pie chart for categorization of solar flares. <br />
        • Line graph for close-approaching asteroids.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">NASA API:</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        For the NASA API I must ensure will be able to have API access and make
        sure that the API will be able to provide the necessary data to create
        the data Visualisation: <br />
        • Solar flare data. <br />
        • Solar flare categorization. <br />
        • Close approaching asteroids.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Bar Graph:</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        Data Requirements: Fetch solar flare data for each month of 2022.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Features: <br />
        - Display monthly data using grey bars. <br />
        - Highlight the month with the maximum solar flares in one distinct
        colour and the month with the least in another. <br />
        - Show the tooltip on hover to display the exact number of solar flares
        for that month.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Pie Chart:</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        Data Requirements: Fetch data for different types of solar flares for a
        user-selected month.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Features: <br />
        - Allow the user to select a month. <br />
        - Generate pie chart segments for each solar flare type. <br />
        - Each segment displays a letter for solar flare categorization and its
        percentage.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Line Graph:</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        Data Requirements: Fetch data of close approaching asteroids for 7 days
        based on a user-selected start date.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Features: <br />
        - Plot data points for each day within the 7 days. <br />
        - Connect data points with a line. <br />
        - Highlight the highest point in red and the lowest point in green.
        <br />
        - Display tooltip with the date, time, and number of close-approaching
        asteroids on hover.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Technical Components:</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        - HTML for structure. <br />
        - CSS for styling. <br />
        - D3.js for data visualization. <br />
        - JavaScript for fetching data and interactions. <br />
        This planning document provides the structured approach which I used in
        starting and creating the visualizations using D3.js and the NASA API.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Why did I choose to do it like this?</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        interactive features: I wanted to include some interactive features
        (e.g., tooltips on hover) in my graphics as the Interactivity
        significantly enhances user experience. Using tooltips, allows users to
        delve deeper into specific data points without overwhelming them with
        too much information upfront as the user can hover over a particular
        aspect and get a more details explanation of it.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Colour Coding: I wanted to use colour coding in the sense of colour
        differentiation as it aids in quick visual understanding. By making the
        highest and lowest bars/dots distinct, it will draw attention to
        significant data points, making the graph more informative at a glance.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        User Control (e.g., month selection for the pie chart, the start date
        for the line graph): I wanted to include this as it gives the users
        control over what data they want to see, which makes the visualizations
        more relevant to each user. It provides a tailored experience and can
        increase user engagement making a more pleasant and comfortable user
        experience.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Use of Different Visualization Types (bar, pie, line): The use of
        different types of data is best represented in different ways.
        Categorical data is well-suited to pie charts, while continuous data is
        better for line graphs. Using a variety of visualization types ensures
        that each data set is represented in the most effective and
        comprehensible way.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Why these graphs and the story it will tell</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        I want to use each type of graph as it is a plan in which each graph
        will tell a specific story while providing insights into the data For my
        first graph, I have chosen a Bar Graph which will show the number of
        Solar Flares that happened in each month in the year 2022. The reason
        for this graph is that it provides an overview of solar flare activity
        throughout the year 2022. The viewer can quickly discern patterns, such
        as which months had the highest or lowest activity. By highlighting the
        highest and lowest bars with distinct colours, the graph emphasizes peak
        and low periods of solar activity.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Allowing for these Key Takeaways: <br />
        - Which month had the most solar flares? <br />
        - Which month had the least? <br />
        - How does solar flare activity fluctuate throughout the year?
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Pie Chart (Categorization of Solar Flares for a Selected Month): This
        chart will break down the different types of solar flares that occurred
        in a specific month. Visualizing the data in pie segments offers
        insights into the dominance of each flare category. Each segment's size
        and the accompanying percentage provide context on the flare's frequency
        and significance.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Allowing for these Key Takeaways: <br />
        - What types of solar flares dominated in the selected month? <br />
        - Which flare types were less common? <br />
        - How do the various flare types compare proportionally?
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Line Graph (Close Approaching Asteroids over 7 days): This line graph
        will offer a timeline of close-approaching asteroid activity over a
        week. It visualizes trends and allows the viewer to understand
        fluctuations in activity during that time frame. The color-coded highest
        and lowest points serve to emphasize the peak and minimum threats,
        respectively.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Allowing for these Key Takeaways: <br />
        - On which date was there the highest number of close-approaching
        asteroids? <br />
        - On which date was the threat the least? <br />
        - How does the threat level change day by day over the week?
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        In essence, the bar graph offers a macro view of solar flare activity
        throughout the year, the pie chart provides a detailed breakdown of
        flare types for a specific month, and the line graph showcases
        short-term trends in asteroid activity over a week. Each graph tells its
        own distinct story, providing context, and insights that help the viewer
        understand the data in meaningful ways.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Colour choices</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        I used the colour grey for standard bars in the bar graph. As the grey
        colour is neutral, that makes it perfect for common data points. Using
        grey for the majority of bars ensures that they don't visually compete
        with the bars as I wanted to highlight (highest and lowest in my graph).
        This way, the coloured bars will stand out more prominently.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        I am using distinctive colours bar the highest and lowest Bars, As these
        colors for the highest and lowest data points instantly draw the
        viewer's attention to them. It acts as a visual cue, emphasizing this
        data point’s significance.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        By using red for the Highest Point in Line Graph I feel it was a good
        choice as it is often associated with urgency, importance, or even
        danger. In the context of the line graph that plots the number of close
        approaching asteroids, a red dot indicating the day with the highest
        number could imply the highest risk or urgency. It's a colour that
        naturally draws the eye, emphasizing the importance of that particular
        data point.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        By using the green for the Lowest Point in Line Graph as effective as
        green is commonly associated with safety, calmness, and positivity. For
        the day with the least number of close approaching asteroids, green
        suggests a day of lesser risk or concern. This colour choice is
        intuitive, especially when contrasted with red, as they are opposites
        both in terms of meaning and position on a colour wheel.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Tooltip Background and Font Color: The tooltip's primary function is to
        provide additional information without distracting from the main graph.
        I will use a dark background colour background colour that contrasts
        nicely with the light font colour which will ensure readability. A
        semi-opaque background will be beneficial to ensure the tooltip does not
        entirely obscure the data beneath it.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        By incorporating these ideas and features, the visualization in my
        project will not only become more user-friendly but also more
        informative, accurate, and accessible. It's a balance of design,
        functionality, and user experience.
