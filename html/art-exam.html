          <h2 class="sub-heading">Purpose for the Player:</h2>
          <p class="post-text">
            Embark on an action-packed adventure to defend the planet, improve
            reflexes, and set new survival time records. With the integration of
            real asteroid data from NASA, every game promises a unique
            challenge. Can you protect the planet and claim the title of the
            ultimate Asteroid Defender?

          <h2 class="sub-heading">
            Communication to the Player about the API and Game:
          </h2>
          <p class="post-text">
            Realism and Authenticity: By using the NASA's NEO API, Asteroid
            Defenders brings a layer of realism in its gameplay. While many
            games may randomly generate obstacles, my game pulls real-world data
            on near-Earth objects, making the threat of asteroids not just a
            game mechanic, but a reflection of actual space objects that NASA
            tracks. This can give players an appreciation or awareness of the
            vastness of space and the objects in space.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            Dynamic Gameplay: With the game refreshing asteroid data by fetching
            from the NASA API, players can anticipate a dynamic gaming
            experience each time. The asteroids' size, speed, and other
            properties are based on real data, ensuring no two game sessions are
            entirely the same.
          </p>

          <h2 class="sub-heading">
            Enhancing or Subverting the Meaning of the API:
          </h2>
          <p class="post-text">Enhancing:</p>
          <p class="post-text">
            - The game enhances the purpose of the NEO API by bringing its data
            to a wider audience in an interactive form. While the API's primary
            intent is for research purposes, the game transforms this data into
            an engaging activity, thereby creating more awareness of NEOs in a
            fun and immersive way.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            - It gives players a tangible interaction with this data, turning
            abstract numbers and statistics into visual obstacles in the game.
