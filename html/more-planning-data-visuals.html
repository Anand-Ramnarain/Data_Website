        For my data visualisation, I have 2 sections in data visualisation. The
        first is solar flare and the other is Astriods. In both of these
        sections, I have 2 graphs.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Solar Flare:</h2>
      <p class="post-text">- 1 Interactive Bar Graph</p>
      <p class="post-text">- 1 Static Pie Chart</p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Asteroid:</h2>
      <p class="post-text">- 1 Interactive line Graph</p>
      <p class="post-text">- 1 Static Pie Chart</p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Solar Flares</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        On the solar flares page, I have a bar graph showcasing the number of
        solar flares each month in the year 2022. By hovering over each bar to
        see the specific number of solar flares and the corresponding month adds
        depth to the user experience. It offers instant and detailed insights
        without cluttering my main visualization. The pie chart is static but
        the user can choose the month to see the breakdown of solar flare types.
        By allowing the users to choose a specific month and then presenting a
        breakdown of the types of solar flares in a pie chart, they can
        understand the data better.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Asteroids</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        For the asteroid page, I have 1 Interactive visualization, a line graph,
        so the users have more engagement with the interactive graph, as it
        provides a deeper experience, allowing users to extract specific data
        points of interest, such as how many asteroids are closing and
        approaching earth. The static pie chart is also there to provide more
        insight into the asteroid as the user can select the date and they can
        see the different sizes of the asteroid that are represented in the line
        graph. This offers a diverse representation of the data. As i presenting
        data in both a line graph and a pie chart. While the line graph shows
        trends how the number of asteroids, the pie chart gives a holistic view
        of the sizes of the asteroids. I am also allowing for user
        customization, as the users can choose data for the pie chart and line
        graph, providing them with a sense of control and letting them explore
        specific dates of interest. This will increase user engagement. With the
        interactive graph, by hovering over dots in a line graph, users can
        quickly gather information without navigating to another page or
        section. It's a quick way to convey detailed data.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Why 1 Interactive & 1 Static</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        Balancing the visuals between interactive and static on my website
        creates a consistent blend for user engagement and clear data
        presentation. The use of both styles allows for user preferences and to
        delve deeper into what the data is trying to represent. One of the most
        important reasons for this is for user engagement and to represent data
        further so it can be understood. By using both interactive and static
        graphs/charts, the user can choose their dates and investigate further
        the data.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Performance was another key consideration. The Interactive charts, do
        take some time to load, but static charts are lighter in terms of
        loading so the user will always see a graph on the page even if one is
        taking longer to load there will still be one there for them to view.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        The combination of interactive and static visualizations ensures your
        website remains both engaging and informative. It offers depth while
        simultaneously providing clarity for users wanting direct insights. This
        blend of both interactive and static makes the website versatile,
        accessible, and appealing.
