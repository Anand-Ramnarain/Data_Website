        People often disagree about what interaction means in the world of data
        visualization. The term interaction is confusing because there isn't one
        clear definition everyone can agree on. Some look at it from the angle
        of information displays, while others think of it from a tech or design
        perspective. By investigating the article by Evanthia Dimara and Charles
        Perin’ on “What is Interaction for Data Visualization?” and comparing it
        to how Human-Computer Interaction defines it. In this blog, we'll look
        at what everyone is saying to compare the different views while trying
        to come up with a clear and helpful definition that guides designs and
        ideas on what interaction is in data visualisation.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        For us to start to define interaction in data visualisation, we first
        need to investigate the entities and actions needed to understand it.
        There are two types of entities needed to understand the interaction.
        The first is the external entities, this is when the user is at the
        focus point of the interaction and they are the external entity, as the
        user is being described as someone with "skills, abilities, motivation,
        and expertise."(Dimara & Perin 2020) This is because the user can
        connect the data to the visualisation system making it so the
        interaction between the data and visualisation system is instant and
        clear from the beginning to the end.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Additionally, the next is the internal entity. The internal entity is
        not just about the physical action, but it is rather about the
        "cognitive act of the user"(Dimara & Perin 2020) and their goal with the
        data. This is an indication that the internal entity isn’t just about
        the how user touches or interacts with the screen but rather the user’s
        interaction is working towards a specific purpose. Like on my website,
        the users interact on the home page when they click on an option in the
        navigation bar, it guides them to the section or when the user scrolls
        down the page. Their interaction with the website shows how they want to
        view or go to a certain part of it, as there is intent to what they want
        to do. Shows how the user and the system are like a “dialogue”(Dimara &
        Perin 2020), as each action they perform is getting a response. This
        shows how the entities are essential to understanding interaction as
        they allow the users to engage with the website.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Furthermore, we must understand the properties of interaction before
        defining it. One of the most important properties that must include
        interaction is its granularity, this is where it can go from
        "micro-level"(Dimara & Perin 2020) actions, like mouse clicks, to a
        "macro-level"(Dimara & Perin 2020) like data analysis or even
        storytelling with data. but still help us see that through the
        granularity interactions, we can identify the user's engagement with the
        website. It offers us insight into how to guide a data visualisation’s
        interfaces as in the specific actions, like choosing a particular piece
        of data, or whether should it just be done for general tasks, like
        looking at overall trends like what happens within a year.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Furthermore, interactions vary in their properties, this is because
        properties can be either "continuous"(Dimara & Perin 2020), like mouse
        drags to perform a lasso selection, or they can be "discrete"(Dimara &
        Perin 2020), as clicking on a checkbox or button to filter the selection
        of item. Identifying between these 2 properties helps us in
        understanding how the user engages with data visualisation over time.
        This is because it will show us the pace of the user experience on the
        website as it can show us if the user wants to see the specific point on
        the data or just want to be guided through it.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Another set of properties used in interaction is directness or
        indirectness. Indirect interactions are actions or interactions done
        through tools or widgets. They are indirect because they don't engage
        directly with the data's visuals, whereas direct interactions allow the
        user to work directly with the data or objects within the visual.
        Knowing this property enables to use of the data for functionality and
        to make a clear idea of what is represented as the user can grasp the
        visualization and investigate further into it.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Now that we have established the foundation for understanding
        interaction, we can help in building a working definition. Investigating
        the core of data visualisation shows that it is the art of changing
        information into a visual, which will allow users to see different types
        of patterns and insights into the data. (QlikQ 2023) This is how we used
        to see data visualisation and interaction, but modern technology has
        changed over time and the role of the user just being an observer has
        stopped, as now the user must actively engage with the visualisations.
        Showing where the interaction comes from and where is it important. This
        statement aids in defining that interaction as "interaction for
        visualization is the interplay between a person and a data interface
        with a specific intent related to data.”(Dimara & Perin 2020) This
        indicates that the main focus isn’t just the action itself but rather
        the nature of the action and reaction, allowing for a relationship
        between the user and the data.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Furthermore, the definition so far shows us that interaction is much
        more than just a simple point-and-click interaction, but rather a
        connection with “interplay.”(Dimara & Perin 2020) This refers to the
        interaction between the users and the data visualisation, as both the
        user and the data visuals need to be active, and work towards a specific
        purpose, when a user hovers over a point in a line chart, the
        visualization provides detailed information about that data point and
        everything about it. This is important as it allows us to “see the
        patterns in both visualization and HCI."(Dimara & Perin 2020) This
        highlights how valuable it is for users to feel the data visualization
        responds to them, as they can understand it. This highlights the
        importance of interaction in data visualization. As technologies
        progress data becomes important in decision-making, as it allows for the
        users to actively engage with data visualizations while drawing meaning
        from it.

        Therefore, after a careful analysis of the various perspectives on
        interaction in data visualization. We found that even though many people
        define 'interaction' differently, it's about more than just touching or
        using tools. The article “What is Interaction for Data Visualization?”
        shows us that interaction is mainly the deep connection between a user
        and the data visualization. It's not only about the tools used, but it's
        the key link between users and data that helps them understand the
        information better.
