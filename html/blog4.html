        Gaming, at its core, integrates principles of data-driven art, allowing
        players to immerse in environments where every pixel, sound, and
        reaction is the creation of structured data. Therefore, I have crafted a
        game titled Asteroids Defenders for my data-driven art using HTML, CSS
        and Javascript. Asteroid Defenders is not simply an ordinary game, but
        rather an artwork displaying dangers in real-time and actual figures. It
        uses data from NASA's Near-Earth Objects API to connect the data from
        the API with the physicality of gaming. It engages the players with the
        uncertainties and dangers of space and the impact it can have on Earth.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Crafting a game in HTML was a first-time experience for me. I began with
        extensive research on YouTube, exploring different game types and their
        creation techniques. After familiarizing myself with the game-building
        process, the next step was conceptualizing the game. This involved
        figuring out the mechanics, gameplay, and API integration. My idea for
        "Asteroid Defenders" is a canvas-based space shooter where the player
        acts as Earth's final safeguard against approaching asteroids. Earth,
        placed in the centre with a protective shield, faces imminent asteroid
        threats. As a player, the mission is to obliterate these threats before
        they deplete the shield, thereby preventing the annihilation of our
        planet.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        With this clear idea of the game, the creation phase began. I started
        the process by creating the canvas for gameplay, followed by the static
        objects of the stationary Earth and its shield. This was the first step
        as it will always be on the canvas and will never change, The next
        aspect was integrating the player-controlled spaceship, which has
        movement and a shooting mechanic. Thankfully, my prior research played a
        pivotal role in understanding the frame updates, which allowed for the
        implementation of a smoother object movement.

      <p class="post-text">
        I want to use the API to create a form of dynamic data interaction
        within my game, as most games rely on predefined levels, I wanted to
        make it so my game uses the API for the unpredictability of the
        real-time asteroid data. The dynamic interaction with the data allows
        each gameplay experience to be unique, which will play a role in
        emphasising the vastness and unpredictability of space. I want to
        enhance further through the visual representation of the game, by using
        a minimalist visual strategy: a blue planet for Earth, a protective
        shield, and asteroids. By using these simple visuals, it will emphasize
        the data, as it will be the primary focus.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        To create this in my game, I started by firstly focusing on getting one
        wave on asteroids, So I used the API to fetch the data on asteroids,
        from the data provided from the asteroids, I was able to create a
        function that will take that data to created and draw the asteroids on
        the screen. By focusing on this aspect the game will engage with the
        data through the size and speed of the asteroids. It will take the
        estimated diameter of asteroids in real life and place them in the game
        to fit on the screen. To further the real-life feel of the game I made
        it so it will determine the asteroid's speed based on this size as it
        was travelling in real time, I did the same for the damage, as the
        damage for the asteroids is calculated through the size of the asteroids
        as bigger asteroids to more damage to the shield than a smaller one
        would, this also adds to gameplay as larger asteroids feel more
        daunting. The aspect with which I was struggling was the direction of
        asteroids, as I couldn’t implement it so that asteroids would appear in
        the direction they were coming from, so I decided to make it so it is
        randomised. This is so asteroids appear from random directions, but I
        did this also so it can reinforce the idea of the vast, unpredictable
        nature of space. This was the basis of my game and how I worked on it.

        Furthermore, we can investigate how this game ties into being classified
        as data-driven art. The use of the actual data and the visual
        representation in my game overlaps and indicates the growing value of
        data visualization as in “Artistic Data Visualization: Beyond Visual
        Analytics.” They explain how data in data art in an instance represents
        the data set, I understood how my game can be used to combine the
        standard gameplay approach with the ideology behind data visualisation.
        It gets real asteroids' information from NASA's NEO API which populates
        my game with components using real-time data and this is an instance of
        the idea.

        Moreover, Martin Wattenberg suggests that there's a "renewed interest in
        Infovis' role as an intelligence tool",(Wattenberg & Viégas 2007 p 182)
        my game transforms this raw information into a “gamified” model,
        allowing players to engage with real-world data in a fun and interactive
        way. It bridges the gap between "scientific analytic tasks" (Wattenberg
        & Viégas 2007 p 182) and the "implications of the surge of artistic
        interest in visualization." (Wattenberg & Viégas 2007 p 182) By merging
        the traditional principles of game mechanics with data-driven elements,
        it offers players a unique experience that is both entertaining and
        real. In the game, players navigate through an immersive space
        environment where the primary objective is to shield a central planet
        from incoming asteroids. Drawing from this work on the description of
        data-driven visual stories, my game has a blend of exploration and
        explanation, as seen in its visual and interaction design.

        Furthermore, we can investigate my game through the lens of Data-driven
        storytelling. From the point of view dimension, my game visually has
        several components—a central planet, a protecting shield, the control of
        spaceships and approaching asteroids. Similarly to data-driven stories
        that "How data is shown to the reader, including the available encodings
        and any transformations made on the data",(Walny et al. pp68) the game
        uses visual encodings to present the shield health level, the time
        survivors managed to survive and the upcoming asteroid
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Data Stories focus on "a particular set or subset of data
        shown".",(Walny et al. pp 69) These are aimed in the game towards the
        planet's preservation. As the players decide where to place their
        attention, they are controlling the ship, shooting the asteroids, and
        make sure the shield's health is not at zero, making sure the player is
        aware of all these components. It is similar to "visualizations give
        readers their interaction tools for focusing".",(Walny et al.72) As in
        the game from the reading, the players must make choices regarding the
        direction they take will largely determine whether they succeed or fail
        in playing the game in how long they will survive.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Therefore, after an examination of the game "Asteroid Defenders" and its
        interplay with data-driven storytelling, we have found that while
        traditional gaming mechanics serve as the foundation for player
        engagement, the use of live data, from NASA's NEO API, adds a layer of
        realism and unpredictability to the gaming experience. Thus, "Asteroid
        Defenders" stands as an indication of the evolving intersection of
        gaming, art, and real-world data, creating an immersive experience in
        the vast and unpredictable nature of our space.
