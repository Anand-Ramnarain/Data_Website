        The term Data Visualisation is known for its “connection between data
        and computer technology to transform data into a visual or sonic form.”
        (Li 2020) This meaning can help identify a relationship between
        unprocessed data and technology, whereby technology is used to transform
        unprocessed and raw data into processed information shown in a visual
        form that can be easily interpreted and understood. From this
        understanding of data visualisations, we can contemplate the roles of
        the graphical representation of information and data in web development.
        By investigating the forms and perception of data visualisation based on
        the work of Li Qi of 'Overview of Data Visualization' in Embodying Data,
        this blog post will attempt to justify whether data visualisation has an
        essential role in web development.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        To understand data visualisation we first need to evaluate the different
        forms of data. There are two forms of data. The first is primary data,
        which refers to information collected directly from the researcher
        themselves (Benedictine University 2023), uses they collect the data
        through methods like surveys, interviews, and focus groups. The primary
        data is raw, unprocessed information, which can be both qualitative,
        such as interviews that provide insights into individual's experiences,
        and it can also be quantitative, controlled experiments or surveys.
        (Benedictine University 2023) The primary form of data shows the
        specific need of the data while validating its relevance and accuracy.
        For instance, If we were to survey a group of individuals on whether is
        it worth going in-store to buy groceries or order online and how many
        people switch. We can use the data from the gathered surveys to display
        how many people switch to buying groceries online and data we can check
        pricing to evaluate whether it’s worth going in-store or going online.
        Seen in the below table data visualisation of price comparison of using
        checker60 or going in-store.

        class="header-img"
      />
      <p class="post-text">
        Another form of data is secondary data, which refers to data that has
        already been collected by someone else for a different purpose.
        Secondary data is used to save time and money, as well as to gain access
        to data that might be too large or complex to gather personally.
        (Benedictine University 2023) Secondary data may be gathered in a
        different form from primary data but it is still visualised in the same
        aspect as it is put into data visuals. The relationship between primary
        and secondary data and data visualisation is seen in the processing of
        the data as it is a tool to aid in the analysis of the data. Therefore,
        these forms of data are the information that is visualized in data
        visualization, helping researchers, and decision-makers to understand
        the data and make informed decisions and draw conclusions based on it on
        what can be seen in its visual form.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Furthermore, understanding these forms of data allows for the use of
        visualisation techniques. Data visualisation is also known as
        visualisation techniques which create different effects in understanding
        the data to aid in identifying problems and issues. In web development,
        data visualisations have become more diverse and complex over the year,
        as developers need to understand and know how to apply the principles
        and techniques of data visualisation in projects, which aids in
        decision-making while creating a user-friendly experience, it has
        progressed further than merely creating aesthetically pleasing elements,
        making data more meaningful and useful. Even with the creation of
        JavaScript libraries such as D3.js, Chart.js, and Highcharts, which are
        tools which have made it more accessible for the creation of intricate
        and dynamic data visualizations, web developers still need an
        understanding of data visualisation. This is because there are numerous
        forms of visualisation techniques but the most common and traditional
        are Tables, Charts, Trees, Maps, Scatter-plots, Diagrams, Graphs,
        Simulations, Waveforms, and Volume. (Li 2020) Each and everyone one of
        these forms of visualisation offers unique ways to there leveraging
        visual elements to rather tell a story, making the data and information
        more understandable and engaging, making it important as the users will
        remember the data.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        This is mainly because, in web development, data visualisation is
        multifunctional. It can aid in monitoring real-time data (Stevens 2021),
        a line graph could be used to present how the value of a currency
        changed over a certain period or reveal patterns and trends in datasets
        (Stevens 2021), using a histogram to show the number of users per month.
        There are multiple ways in which developers can use data visualisation
        to enhance a user's engagement and retention on a website. This is an
        indication that data visualisation is important in understanding users
        so that they can come back.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Therefore, after careful analysis of the research discussed, we have
        found that data visualisation plays an essential role in web
        development; as it's about making data more clear and actionable.
        Because of the increasing amount of data in every aspect of our lives,
        it's expected that data visualization will continue to be a crucial
        skill for web developers, as it allows for ways in which we can
        understand and interact with data.
