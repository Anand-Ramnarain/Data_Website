            The term Data Visualisation is known for its “connection between
            data and computer technology to transform data into a visual or
            sonic form.” (Li 2020) This meaning can help identify a relationship
            between unprocessed...

            In the digital age, a website is now the first point of contact with
            its audience. However, just having a website is not enough; the way
            a user interacts with the website and experiences it can be the
            difference between a fleeting visit and a lasting impression. User
            Interface focuses on the look and layout, referring to the visual
            aspect. While the user experience dives deeper into the emotional
            and functional experience of users. It examines how users feel as
            they navigate the site. This blog post will attempt to analyse the
            UI...

            People often disagree about what interaction means in the world of
            data visualization. The term interaction is confusing because there
            isn't one clear definition everyone can agree on. Some look at it
            from the angle...

            Gaming, at its core, integrates principles of data-driven art,
            allowing players to immerse in environments where every pixel,
            sound, and reaction is the creation of structured data. Therefore, I
            have crafted a game titled Asteroids Defenders for my data-driven
            art using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Asteroid Defenders is not simply
