            For my data visualisation, I have 2 sections in data visualisation.
            The first is solar flare and the other is Astriods. In both of these
            sections, I have 2 graphs.
          </p>
          <h2 class="sub-heading">Solar Flare:</h2>
          <p class="post-text">- 1 Interactive Bar Graph</p>
          <p class="post-text">- 1 Static Pie Chart</p>
          <h2 class="sub-heading">Asteroid:</h2>
          <p class="post-text">- 1 Interactive line Graph</p>
          <p class="post-text">- 1 Static Pie Chart</p>

          <h2 class="sub-heading">Solar Flares</h2>
          <p class="post-text">
            On the solar flares page, I have a bar graph showcasing the number
            of solar flares each month in the year 2022. By hovering over each
            bar to see the specific number of solar flares and the corresponding
            month adds depth to the user experience. It offers instant and
            detailed insights without cluttering my main visualization. The pie
            chart is static but the user can choose the month to see the
            breakdown of solar flare types. By allowing the users to choose a
            specific month and then presenting a breakdown of the types of solar
            flares in a pie chart, they can understand the data better.
          </p>

          <h2 class="sub-heading">Asteroids</h2>
          <p class="post-text">
            For the asteroid page, I have 1 Interactive visualization, a line
            graph, so the users have more engagement with the interactive graph,
            as it provides a deeper experience, allowing users to extract
            specific data points of interest, such as how many asteroids are
            closing and approaching earth. The static pie chart is also there to
            provide more insight into the asteroid as the user can select the
            date and they can see the different sizes of the asteroid that are
            represented in the line graph. This offers a diverse representation
            of the data. As i presenting data in both a line graph and a pie
            chart. While the line graph shows trends how the number of
            asteroids, the pie chart gives a holistic view of the sizes of the
            asteroids. I am also allowing for user customization, as the users
            can choose data for the pie chart and line graph, providing them
            with a sense of control and letting them explore specific dates of
            interest. This will increase user engagement. With the interactive
            graph, by hovering over dots in a line graph, users can quickly
            gather information without navigating to another page or section.
            It's a quick way to convey detailed data.
